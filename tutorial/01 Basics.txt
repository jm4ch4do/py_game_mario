Design Patterns Used
Observer: When the snail leaves the screen it notifies the EnenmyManager 
          Class calling a function provided as parameter when the Snail 
          object was created. 
Dependency Injection: Classes like Player and Snail receive World and 
                      Status objects and expect them to have certain 
                      properties and methods.
